#World Gen
#A Designer, Simulator, and Destroyer of Worlds.

## What is World Gen?
I hate designing worlds from scratch. Whether these worlds are for tabletop-RPGs, video games, or fantasy novels, I hate starting from scratch. I find it much easier to be given a world, and flesh it out from there.

World Gen hopes to eliminate that problem. Primarily, World Gen will work as a world generator, with data accessible to both two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics programs. Later, I hope to allow for natural placement and development of civilizations according to the generated layout of the map, or a pre-developed map (will require user to format map data to accessible standards). Further, I would lke World Gen to expand upon a timespan and show the natural (through social theory algorithms, world development algorithms, and some user-tweaked survivability rates) development of both the world and those that inhabit it. 
## What inspired World Gen?
The original inspiration for World Gen was a similar system utilized by Bay12's Dwarf Fortress.
